TODO: add a delete^ operator
TODO: add support for global variables (and their scope)
TODO: add a "constant" value for unchangable types, which may NOT be used as an lvalue in a "set" node.

long-term to do:
check if "pass" works correctly in codegen phase, including automatic-"return 0" fallback, like C.
should variable declarations *always* have values?
exceptions?
